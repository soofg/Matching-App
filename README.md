# MatchingClothing

This app revolves about two things clothing & friends. As a user you send a request out to other users to find your outfit for a special occassion. Other users see this request choose an outfit for this user and send this out. This way you get multiple suggestions, you choose one and you indirectly match with their opinion and fashion taste. You can become friends by saving them on your friend list. 

You look good and you meet new people to build friendships with!
